# rust-chat-server

Understanding async rust better by implementing a chat-server from scratch

## How to run

`cargo run`

`telnet localhost 8080`

## Branch 1 - Echo server

Currently implemented and heavily commented is an echo server.

Will slowly remove the comments but for now, it's a good reference for understanding the code.

## References

For the initial implementation, I followed the tutorial [Lily Mara -Creating a Chat Server with async Rust and Tokio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mWg91sx-o).

Once I get past the basic implementation, I will be implementing more features and making it more robust.
